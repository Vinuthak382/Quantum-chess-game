# Quantum-chess-game
Welcome to the Quantum Chess Game Project! This project explores the fusion of quantum computing and the classic game of chess, offering an exciting and educational gaming experience. By leveraging the power of the Qiskit library, the project implements a quantum circuit to simulate chess moves on a quantum chess board. Players can enjoy the strategic gameplay of chess while gaining insights into quantum concepts and computing. This project serves as an interactive introduction to the potential applications of quantum computing in gaming and provides a platform to explore the fascinating world of quantum mechanics through an engaging gameplay experience.
